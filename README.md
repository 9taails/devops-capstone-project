This repository is built upon the starter code from the project in [**IBM-CD0285EN-SkillsNetwork DevOps Capstone Project**](https://www.coursera.org/learn/devops-capstone-project?specialization=devops-and-software-engineering) which is part of the [**IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Professional Certificate**](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/devops-and-software-engineering)

## Project Overview
This project will use DevOps practices and follow Test Driven Development for creating a simple web application and deploying it to production. The development process will include Sprint planning, building the app image and running it as a container using Kubernetes. Following CI principles, there will be automated testing set up to validate every update based on best coding practices, user requirements and security best practoces. Following that, a CD pipeline will be set in OpenShift.

## Project layout

The code for the microservice is contained in the `service` package. All of the test are in the `tests` folder. The code follows the **Model-View-Controller** pattern with all of the database code and business logic in the model (`models.py`), and all of the RESTful routing on the controller (`routes.py`).
